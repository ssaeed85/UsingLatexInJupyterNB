# Using LaTeX In Jupyter Notebooks



## What is *LaTeX*?

>_LaTeX, which is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech» (to rhyme with «blech» or «Bertolt Brecht»), is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.\

This git is designed to be a primer in using *LaTeX* in Jupyter notebooks with the intention of improving presentation.

*LaTeX* is a powerful tool in making your markdowns cells look more professional and stand out. One can introduce *LaTeX* into the Jupyter Notebooks markdown cells using imported libraries, however, Jupyter Notebook natively leverages JavaScripts library MathJax to allow rendering of special characters and formatting. Its intended to allow for displaying mathematical functions and text in a more legible format and is widely used in academia.

## Jupyter_Workbook

Note that github's website cannot accurately render *LaTeX*. This markdown is kept free of *LaTeX* operations and they are reserved to the *Jupyter_Workbook* that is in this repo. Fetch a copy and run on a local Jupyter environment.

This notebook aims to act like a cheat sheet for commonly used formatting examples. As we get progress along in the notebook, explanations will be limited to expounding on usage idiosyncrasies of the function in question. 

In other words, sections later in the book rely on knowledge of previous sections.

For reference, the contents of the *Jupyter_Workbook* are as follows:
### Table of Contents
